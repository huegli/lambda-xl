# Atari 800 Emulator for macOS — High‑Level Design (HLD)[10].

## Purpose and scope

- Define a native macOS application that embeds the C‑based libatari800 core through a Swift interoperability layer, exposing clean Swift APIs for UI, media, and I/O subsystems[12].  
- Establish macOS‑native rendering, audio, input, and document semantics using Core Graphics, Core Audio, GameController, and NSDocument within a SwiftUI app following current Apple HIG patterns[10].  

## Non‑goals

- Reimplement Atari hardware emulation (CPU/ANTIC/POKEY), which remains delegated to libatari800[5].  
- Provide cross‑platform UI or non‑macOS packaging; this design targets macOS exclusively using SwiftUI/AppKit integration points[13].  

## System overview

- The app is a document‑based SwiftUI macOS application that hosts libatari800 through a Swift/C bridge, orchestrating emulation on a background thread and streaming video/audio to the UI layer while processing input via GameController and keyboard events[14].  
- State persistence uses NSDocument for open media and app‑managed save states, with preferences stored in user defaults and per‑document metadata in sidecars when appropriate[15].

## Key components

- SwiftUI presentation layer: windows, menus, inspectors, and settings designed per Apple’s current Human Interface Guidelines and SwiftUI capabilities announced at WWDC25[10][11].  
- Controller layer (Swift): EmulatorController, AudioManager, VideoRenderer, InputManager, DocumentCoordinator, each providing thread‑safe facades over the C core and platform services[12].  
- Swift–C interop layer: bridging header and thin C wrappers exporting stable C symbols and POD types for Swift import, with lifetime and error translation to Swift Error[12][16].  
- libatari800 core: compiled as a static library or module interface, providing CPU, graphics, sound, and device emulation with configuration options for 400/800/XL/XE/5200 modes[5].  
- Platform adapters: Core Graphics pixel upload and scaling, Core Audio output units and buffers, GameController device discovery and mapping, NSDocument for file lifecycle and autosave[17][18][19][14].  

## External dependencies and assets

- libatari800 source and headers from the upstream project or a vetted fork pinned by commit for reproducibility and API stability[5].  
- BIOS ROMs required by Atari systems (e.g., ATARIXL.ROM, ATARIOSB.ROM, ATARIBAS.ROM, 5200.ROM) with user‑provided placement and validation UX, mirroring common emulator expectations[4].  
- Apple frameworks: SwiftUI/AppKit, Core Graphics, GameController, Core Audio, Foundation, Uniform Type Identifiers, and App Services for document and file integration[10][18][17].  

## Functional requirements

- Load and run media: cartridges (.car/.bin), disk images (.atr/.xfd/.dcm), executables (.xex/.bas), optionally compressed variants, subject to core support[4].  
- System configuration: select machine (400/800/XL/XE/5200), video standard (NTSC/PAL), memory size, BASIC enablement, and SIO acceleration toggles exposed in preferences and per‑document overrides[3].  
- Video: render the emulated framebuffer at 60Hz with pixel‑accurate nearest‑neighbor scaling and optional filtering, supporting full screen and resizable windows[17].  
- Audio: low‑latency playback synchronized with video, with device switching and volume control integrated into app preferences[20].  
- Input: keyboard mapping for Atari keys, joystick/paddle emulation via GameController, per‑profile mappings, and hot‑plug handling[18][19].  
- Save/restore: instant save states and automatic resume per document; export/import of save state bundles with metadata[15].  
- Documents: standard open/reopen/recent files, autosave in place, file associations for supported UTI types, and Quick Look thumbnails where feasible[14].  

## Non‑functional requirements

- Performance: sustain 60fps rendering on Apple Silicon and Intel targets while maintaining audio/video sync and responsive UI[11].  
- Stability: no leaks, deterministic teardown of emulation threads, and robust error surfaces for file and ROM validation[12].  
- Accessibility: VoiceOver labels, keyboard navigation, sufficient contrast, and dynamic type accommodations where applicable in controls and chrome[10].  
- Compliance: App Store review guidelines, sandbox entitlements for file access via user consent, and notarization for distribution[21].  

## Architecture and data flows

- Emulation loop runs on a dedicated background thread, ticking libatari800, producing a video buffer and audio samples batched for the UI and audio pipelines respectively[12].  
- VideoRenderer transforms the core’s pixel format into a Core Graphics bitmap context for presentation, with frame pacing and vsync alignment in the display link or render timer[17].  
- AudioManager manages ring buffers between the core and Core Audio output, handling sample rate conversion and glitch mitigation via buffer watermarking[20].  
- InputManager translates GameController and keyboard events into libatari800 input calls, with remapping profiles and dead‑zone/curve configurations for analog inputs[18].  

## Public interfaces (for LLD expansion)

- EmulatorController API surface: init/shutdown, loadMedia(url:), start/pause/reset, step, setOption(key:value:), queryState(), saveState(url:), loadState(url:)[12].  
- VideoRenderer API surface: configure(pixelFormat:dimensions:), present(frame:timestamp:), setScaling(mode:), setCRTArtifacting(enabled:)[17].  
- AudioManager API surface: configure(sampleRate:channels:), enqueue(samples:), setOutputDevice(id:), setVolume(level:)[20].  
- InputManager API surface: registerDevice(id:meta:), map(physical:to:), onEvent(device:event:), setProfile(profile:), keyboardMatrix(set:)[18].  
- DocumentCoordinator API surface: createDocument(for:media:), read/write, autosave hooks, recent items integration, UTI/Quick Look providers[14].  

## File types and document model

- Supported UTIs and extensions: .a52 .atr .bas .bin .car .dcm .xex .xfd (plus optional compressed forms), modeled as read‑only documents with sidecar save states to avoid mutating originals by default[4].  
- Save state bundle: directory or archive including core snapshots, metadata (ROM hash, machine, video standard), thumbnail, and versioning for forward‑compat checks[3].  
- Preferences schema: machine profile defaults, input profiles, video scaling and filters, audio device/latency settings, ROM search paths, and BIOS discovery settings[3].  

## Swift–C interoperability

- Adopt a minimal C shim that exposes stable, Swift‑friendly signatures over libatari800 to avoid importing internal headers directly into Swift, keeping the ABI surface intentional[12].  
- Use a bridging header to import the C shim into Swift, with careful ownership annotations and explicit buffer lifetimes to prevent leaks or double frees[12].  
- Translate core error codes into Swift Error and Swift Result types at the API boundary to standardize error handling in the Swift layer[16].  

## UI and UX design

- SwiftUI app structure with App/Scene for main windows, Commands for menus, Settings scene for preferences, and NSViewRepresentable shims where AppKit is needed[13].  
- HIG‑aligned window chrome: toolbar for quick actions (pause, reset, media swap), titlebar accessories for indicators, and contextual inspectors for per‑document tuning[10].  
- Controller pairing and mapping UI leveraging GameController to present devices, binding layouts, and test harnesses for input verification[18].  
- Accessibility: labels for controls, focus order, color/contrast options for overlays, and VoiceOver navigation in menus and inspectors[10].  

## Input strategy

- Support keyboard and modern controllers (Xbox, PlayStation, MFi) with GameController, including profiles for digital joystick, twin‑stick modes, and paddle emulation[19][18].  
- Provide per‑document and global mappings with presets, export/import of configurations, and automatic resolution of device identity changes on reconnect[22].  

## Rendering strategy

- Core Graphics bitmap contexts for pixel‑accurate output with GPU‑backed layers when available, configurable nearest‑neighbor scaling and optional smoothing, plus overscan controls[17].  
- Optional CRT artifacting and blending toggles surfaced as user options, mapped to equivalent core settings when supported[3].  

## Audio strategy

- Core Audio output node configured for low latency with a producer–consumer queue between the emulation thread and the output callback to avoid underflows[20].  
- Sample rate negotiation and conversion with headroom buffers to maintain A/V sync under variable load and device changes[20].  

## Threading and synchronization

- Single emulation thread with lock‑free ring buffers for video frames and audio samples, synchronized via sequence counters or timestamps to the render and audio callbacks[12].  
- UI interactions scheduled to the main thread; configuration changes marshaled to the emulation thread via a command queue to maintain consistency[13].  

## Settings and configuration

- Global preferences: machine defaults, video scaling/filtering, audio device/latency, input profiles, ROM paths, BIOS paths, telemetry consent where applicable[10].  
- Per‑document overrides: machine variant, video standard, BASIC on/off, fast SIO, artifacting, and per‑document input profile selection[3].  

## Error handling and diagnostics

- User‑facing errors for missing/invalid BIOS, unsupported media, corrupted save states, and audio device failures with actionable remediation[4].  
- Diagnostics: rolling logs with log levels, frame time statistics, audio underrun counters, and controller event traces for troubleshooting[11].  

## Security, privacy, and compliance

- Sandbox with user‑mediated file access, temporary access bookmarks for recent items, and limited entitlements consistent with App Store policies[21].  
- No unexpected network access; optional crash reports and analytics gated by explicit consent and documented in privacy statements[21].  

## Build, packaging, and distribution

- Xcode project with separate targets for the app and the C shim/core, build settings for Apple Silicon and Intel (if supported), and unit/ui test bundles[11].  
- Code signing, notarization, and App Store distribution readiness with correct Info.plist, UTIs, document types, Quick Look support, and hardened runtime[21][23].  

## Performance plan

- Use Instruments to profile CPU hotspots, frame pacing, and audio callback timing; target zero dropped frames at 60Hz under normal load on Apple Silicon[11].  
- Optimize memory and allocations in tight loops; preallocate render/audio buffers; avoid main‑thread stalls by using background queues for I/O[11].  

## Testing strategy

- Unit tests for Swift wrappers (error translation, lifetime rules), and configuration parsing/mapping logic[24].  
- Integration tests for emulation lifecycle, A/V sync thresholds, input mapping correctness, and save state round‑trips across versions[11].  
- Accessibility audits, window/menu conformance checks, and controller hot‑plug tests across common device families[18].  

## Rollout and telemetry

- Staged releases with manual and TestFlight‑for‑macOS style external testing, collecting structured feedback on compatibility and UX[21].  
- Optional, privacy‑respecting telemetry for performance counters and feature use to inform roadmap decisions, off by default[21].  

## Risks and mitigations

- Upstream libatari800 API drift: pin commits and wrap through a local C shim to stabilize the imported surface[12].  
- Audio/video sync under load: maintain buffer watermarks and dynamic pacing, with user‑visible latency controls[20].  
- BIOS distribution/legal: require user‑provided ROMs with clear guidance and validation, without bundling proprietary assets[4].  

## Milestones and phases

- Phase 1: Project setup, architecture, bridging, and document scaffolding[13].  
- Phase 2: libatari800 integration and emulation loop with minimal A/V paths[5].  
- Phase 3: Core features—media loading, save states, configuration surfaces[3].  
- Phase 4: macOS integration—Core Graphics, Core Audio, GameController, NSDocument polish[17][18][14].  
- Phase 5: UI development—SwiftUI, preferences, inspectors, accessibility, and HIG alignment[10][11].  
- Phase 6: Testing, optimization, packaging, and compliance[21][23].
## Open questions for LLD

- Exact buffer formats and conversion paths between libatari800 and Core Graphics to minimize copies and color space issues[17].  
- Audio sample rate, buffer sizing, and conversion strategy tuned for stability across devices while keeping latency low[20].  
- Default controller mappings and per‑system presets (400/800/XL/XE/5200) for intuitive out‑of‑box behavior[18].  
- Save state format versioning and migration policy to ensure forward compatibility across releases[15].
