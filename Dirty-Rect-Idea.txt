   **Analyzing Dirty Rectangles**

   I'm currently digging into the `libatari800` library, specifically within the `atari800` directory, to figure out if it efficiently identifies partial frame modifications. The goal is to understand how well it handles "dirty rectangles" or "dirty regions" for optimized rendering. My focus now is on the implementation details within the library's code base to understand this functionality.

   **Reviewing Library Documentation**

   I'm now investigating the `DOC` directory within `atari800`. My current efforts involve poring over the documentation to find mentions of partial frame updates, specifically searching for any details about "dirty rectangles" or similar optimization techniques. I am keen to understand if the library directly addresses this, and if so, how it has been implemented.

   **Examining Documentation Search**

   I'm currently looking through the `DOC` directory of `libatari800`, as I previously noted. My search terms are "dirty" and "partial". Hopefully, these will turn up some relevant leads within the available documentation. I'm keen to find something to help me understand this codebase further.

   **Investigating Frame Updates**

   I've made significant progress in exploring the `DOC` directory. The initial search results are quite encouraging. I've identified that the library likely supports partial frame updates. Specifically, the files `HOWTO-DIRTYRECT` and `HOWTO-DIRTYSPAN` seem to be key, as they detail the mechanisms involved.

   **Scoping Out Code Search**

   I've now refined my strategy after reviewing the documentation. The focus shifts to the source code, specifically searching for implementations of `DIRTYRECT` and `DIRTYSPAN`. I plan to begin by examining the functions that handle screen updates and understand how the "dirty" flags and spans are managed to optimize the update process. Keywords like "dirty", "rect", "span", and "update" will be invaluable for code navigation.

   **Mapping Dirty Regions**

   My investigation of the `DOC` directory provided excellent context. I've got a solid grasp of the `DIRTYRECT` and `DIRTYSPAN` methodologies now. The `ChangeLog` and `NEWS` files clarify that the `DIRTYRECT` method saw implementation, and eventually gave way to an approach more adept at full-screen updates. I'm shifting gears; focusing on the source code, I will begin using search tools for "dirty," "partial," and "update" within the `atari800/src` directory.

   **Examining Preprocessor Macros**

   I've been looking into the usage of `DIRTYRECT` and `DIRTYSPAN`. The search shows `DIRTYRECT` is a preprocessor macro, conditionally compiling functionality, which makes sense. I found it defined in `wince/port/missing.h` as well. It's a strong clue.

   **Unpacking Conditional Compilation**

   I'm now focused on the implementation details. `#ifdef DIRTYRECT` blocks are my target. I'm examining `screen.h` to see how data structures are impacted, then diving into `antic.c` and `screen.c` to decode how the dirty regions are managed. It seems the feature is there, but might be toggled.

   **Investigating Dirty Regions**

   I'm now looking into the `screen.h` file. It declares `Screen_dirty`, a likely indicator of dirty regions, as per the `HOWTO-DIRTYRECT`. Also, the `Screen_EntireDirty(void)` function is there. It seems like I'm on the right track.

   **Scrutinizing ANTIC's Role**

   I've started exploring `antic.c`, as the ANTIC chip is key for screen modifications. My initial search for `Screen_dirty` yielded promising results, so I'm digging into how the video coprocessor interacts with this dirty region tracking. I'm hoping to find where the screen updates are actually triggered.

   **Observing Screen Updates**

   I've been scrutinizing the `antic.c` search results, particularly the `Screen_dirty` array. It seems clear that this array acts as a flag, marking modified sections of the screen buffer. Specifically, when `Screen_atari` is altered, `Screen_dirty` gets updated to reflect these changes. I'm now trying to comprehend the underlying calculations used to determine where exactly the dirty flags get set.

   **Tracing Dirty Rectangles**

   I've moved onto `screen.c`, searching for uses of `Screen_dirty`. Found the `Screen_EntireDirty()` function, which seems to mark the whole screen as dirty, as its name suggests. Now I'm examining how this array is read to determine the rectangles that need redrawing, focusing on the screen update routines.

   **Considering Screen Dirtying**

   I'm currently focused on the `Screen_dirty` variable within `screen.c`. It seems `Screen_dirty` is initialized to `NULL` before being allocated memory using `Util_malloc`, based on `Screen_HEIGHT`. This suggests a mechanism to track modifications to the screen buffer. Further investigation is needed to understand how `Screen_dirty` is utilized for optimized screen updates.

   **Confirming Dirty Rectangles**

   I've confirmed the existence of a dirty rectangle mechanism! The `Screen_dirty` array, initialized to `NULL`, gets memory allocated based on screen dimensions, with each byte representing 8 horizontal pixels. The `Screen_EntireDirty()` function sets all bytes in `Screen_dirty` to 1, indicating a fully dirty screen. This confirms a frame update optimization.

   **Understanding Completion**

   My analysis is complete. I have a clear understanding of the dirty rectangle implementation. The system utilizes a `Screen_dirty` array, where each byte represents 8 pixels of screen width. Functions in `antic.c` set these bytes to indicate modifications. It provides optimized display updates, relying on the client application's implementation to act upon the dirty rectangle data.

   **Summarizing Implementation's Mechanics**

   My understanding now extends to the specific functions managing the dirty rectangle system. `Screen_dirty` is initialized, allocated, and updated as analyzed. `Screen_EntireDirty()` marks all areas for update. Furthermore, the `antic.c` code likely utilizes these mechanisms for optimized rendering. The client app reads the `Screen_dirty` array.

   **Summarizing Dirty Rectangles**

   I've completed my analysis. The system uses a `Screen_dirty` array, mapping 8-pixel blocks. The `DIRTYRECT` macro enables this. `antic.c` flags changes; the port reads the array. `Screen_EntireDirty()` marks all dirty, and a `DIRTYSPAN` implementation was not found in the source code.

   **Finalizing Implementation Details**

   I've completed the research.  The `Screen_dirty` array maps 8-pixel blocks. `antic.c` flags changes using the `DIRTYRECT` macro. The application then reads the data for updates. The `Screen_EntireDirty()` function forces a full refresh. My investigation is now complete.



   Yes, the `libatari800` library provides a mechanism to detect if only parts of the frame have been modified. This is implemented using a technique called "dirty rectangles", which can be enabled at compile time.

   Here's a summary of my findings:

   *   **`DIRTYRECT` and `DIRTYSPAN`:** The documentation in `atari800/DOC` mentions two techniques: `HOWTO-DIRTYRECT` and `HOWTO-DIRTYSPAN`. These documents describe how to track and update only the changed portions of the screen to improve performance.
   *   **`DIRTYRECT` Implementation:** The source code in `atari800/src` contains numerous references to `DIRTYRECT` as a preprocessor macro (`#ifdef DIRTYRECT`). This indicates that the feature is conditionally compiled.
   *   **`Screen_dirty` Array:** When `DIRTYRECT` is enabled, a global array named `Screen_dirty` is used to track the dirty regions of the screen. Each element in this array corresponds to a small block of pixels on the screen.
   *   **Marking Dirty Regions:** The code in `antic.c`, which emulates the Atari's ANTIC video chip, is responsible for marking the appropriate entries in the `Screen_dirty` array when the screen content changes.
   *   **Partial Updates:** The client application or the "port" of the emulator is then responsible for reading the `Screen_dirty` array and only updating the parts of the screen that are marked as dirty.
   *   **`DIRTYSPAN`:** While `DIRTYSPAN` is mentioned in the documentation as a more efficient alternative to `DIRTYRECT`, I found no evidence of its implementation in the source code. It appears to be a conceptual or proposed feature.

   In conclusion, `libatari800` does have a built-in mechanism for partial frame updates, but it needs to be enabled by defining the `DIRTYRECT` macro when compiling the library.
